The \textit{Communications} microservice acts as a single relaying party between the services within the system and the chosen email provider, \textit{SendGrid}. When there is the requirement for a service to send an email, they do so via the API provided by the \textit{Communications} service. This API provides convenience to the services by enabling them to identify the recipient of the email either by the email address, or their user ID. Whilst email libraries exist within the frameworks used, which would have allowed each service to independently send emails, implementing an intermediate service ensured consistency with regards to email origin and general formatting. This also allowed the email provider to be easily changed by providing a different implementation of the IEmailSender within the \textit{Communications} service.
