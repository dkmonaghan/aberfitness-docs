The \textit{Communications} microservice acts as a middleman between all of the various microservices and our chosen email sending provider, \textit{SendGrid}. Whenever a service wishes to send an email, they utilise the \textit{Communications} API, which then handles the request appropriately. Whilst it would have been just as easy to integrate SendGrid directly into our various services, we wanted to create a generic intermediary interface so that the email provider used for the entire system could be changed system wide in one simple change. The use of the Communications interface also meant that debugging email issues system wide would be easier.
