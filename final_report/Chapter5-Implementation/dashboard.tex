\subsubsection{MVC Architecture}
\par
The Health Dashboard was included in the design of the system to allow users to visualise and add to their activity data, personal goals and group challenges. To this end, the Health Dashboard does not have a need for a persistence layer, as all of the data it processes are stored and accessed from other microservices on the system. This lead to the service being designed initially with one controller and its associated views, with model classes existing only to aid in manipulating retrieved data.

\par
Initially the service was to only have one controller, \textit{DashboardController}, but part-way through the project it was noted that splitting off the administrative functionality of the Health Dashboard to another controller could be worthwhile. Later on in the project it was decided that administrative functionality would be better placed in microservices that control the data, and so the concept was dropped. The name of the single controller was later changed to \textit{HomeController} for semantic and technical reasons associated with a repeated pattern in the URL (\textit{dockerN.aberfitness.biz/dashboard/dashboard/\{action\}}).

\subsubsection{User Interface Style and AJAX}
\par
As the User Interface is a prime concern for this microservice, implementation of an open-source and professional template was high-priority, once data processing spike-work was completed. A template was decided on with the aim to implement it into every microservice eventually. Unfortunately, some time after being implemented as part of the Health Dashboard, the template was later changed to integrate better with Bootstrap 4 and to be simpler in DOM terms. While certainly a major advantage for the other microservices, it resulted in some time being lost to re-implementing the existing view files.

% TODO Find some more to say here, maybe?
\par
In order to keep the user experience fluid, goal and activity data deletion and the simple steps recorder use AJAX on the webpage instead of using a form submission.
