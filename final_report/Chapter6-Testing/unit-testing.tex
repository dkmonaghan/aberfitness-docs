\section{Unit Testing}
\par
Unit tests provides a mechanism for developers  to verify the behaviour of each component in isolation. Tests for each component gives the project an automated baseline which significantly reduces the chance of a logic or syntax error being merged into the codebase. The entire unit test suite is run as part of the pull request flow, reducing the chances of bugs or regressions entering the codebase.

\subsection{Framework Choices}
Whilst multiple testing frameworks exist for both .NET Core and Java, it made sense to unanimously use the same set across all services. The development teams greed on using \textit{xUnit}\cite{xUnit} for C\# and \textit{JUnit}\cite{JUnit} for JavaEE early into the project.

\par
For .NET applications we choose xUnit instead of \textit{MSTest} and \textit{NUnit}. Recent documentation and examples from Microsoft have focused on xUnit instead of MSTest. xUnit is less accessible initially but significantly more extensible which can simply test code through the use of the \textit{Theory} attribute.

\par
Additionally, xUnit extends upon principles found in NUnit with additional features, such as the ability to execute individual test methods \cite{Nunit_XUnit_comparison}. It also creates a new test instance for each fixture, ensuring that side effects do not propergate through a test suite. This prevents problems with ordering tests found in some software projects.

\par
JUnit is an almost ubiquitous testing framework for Java for a few reasons. It has strong integration with other tools, such as Maven and various mocking frameworks, and documentation is widely available. Multiple versions exist so the Java teams chose to use version 5, as it is the latest stable release on JUnit.

\subsection{Mocking}
\par
\textit{Moq}\cite{Moq} is used for mocking the persistence layer in .NET Core services. Controllers were written using the dependency injection pattern, thereby accepting a concrete type at construction time. Using Moq objects is extremely simple; developers instantiate their mock based on an interface, then setup expectations, if any, and verify the calls.

\par
Java requires a slightly different approach, as an EJB cannot have arguments in its constructor. \textit{Mockito}\cite{Mockito} provides an alternative to dependency injection; developers create fields in the class which matchthe  types which are constructed in the EJB. These are annotated with `\textit{@mock}' and subsequently injected with `\textit{@injectMocks}' on the test instance. Mockito supports \textit{Hamcrest}\cite{Hamcrest} matchers which was also used to handle more complex assertions.

\par
As each unit test completes in a short time, seconds at the longest, these test suites can be run rapidly from the IDE or CLI. This formed a quality control mechanism which was run before all changes were accepted.
