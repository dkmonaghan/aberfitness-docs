\section{Static Analysis}
\subsection{PMD}
\par
Initially, Java used \textit{CheckStyle} to also enforce coding style conventions. However, the rules were far too strict to be beneficial or practical and, unlike other formatting tools, there was no option to emit a patch-file which allows developers to automatically fix-up many errors such as incorrect white space or formatting.

\par
The Java teams later migrated to the \textit{PMD}\cite{PMD} static analysis tool: this warns about unused fields and variables, unsafe constructs, and dangerous coding patterns.
The Maven test target was modified to run the PMD static analysis tool before any unit tests. If any violations were detected the build would immediately stop, ensuring all modifications were inspected.
