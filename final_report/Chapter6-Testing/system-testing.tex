\section{System Testing}
\par
Aber Fitness was deployed onto two separate \textit{Docker} hosts, representing staging and production. Developers could trigger a deployment from the latest development images in \textit{Slack}, and then manually test the system in a deployed state. This also allowed for the detection of deployment specific problems, which are un-testable without a complete system.

\par
One example of an issue caught by manual system testing was within the \textit{Challenges} microservices, which contained a controller which was not operating asynchronously. Unit tests would not exercise the instance in parallel, so this bug was not caught in unit testing. The bug resulted in API calls made to the deployed application causing a HTTP 502 respons, due to the original call putting the controller in a blocked state and preventing it from responding to the next call.
