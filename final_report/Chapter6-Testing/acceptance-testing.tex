\section{Acceptance Testing}
\par
During our first meeting the project's functional requirements were broken down in a spreadsheet based on the service which would implement them. The client was then contacted to clarify any requirements which were ambiguous to the group. Acceptance tests for each micro-service were added to a spreadsheet based on these agreed requirements.

\par
Acceptance tests are completed manually by completing the documented steps. Each test is marked as pass or fail based on the criteria also set out in the document, allowing the project to be assessed on its fitness for purpose.
