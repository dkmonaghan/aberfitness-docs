Overall, the vast majority of the client's requirements have been developed and implemented successfully. Any outstanding bugs or features not implemented which are specific to individual microservices are noted in the following subsections.

Four acceptance tests were defined for the system as a whole, with the acceptance test table available in Appendix 2, Section 0.2.1. Of these four tests, only one failed. The failed test required that the system support localisation. It was decided amongst the group that, due to time restraints, localisation would be left until later on in the project when it could be re-evaluated whether or not there was time to implement the feature. While localisation was investigated as part of the spike work, once the system was implemented there was not enough time to modify the existing views and prepare them for integration with a localisation system.
