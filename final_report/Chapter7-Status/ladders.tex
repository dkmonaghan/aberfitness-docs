Please see acceptance test table in Appendix 2, Section 0.2.9.

A total of 38 acceptance tests are defined for the \textit{Ladders} microservice, as it features fairly complex interfaces with a lot of options. Of these 38 tests, only three have failed. Two of the three failing tests relate to users leaving ladders, and as such are less likely to be encountered by users than the other test cases.


\begin{itemize}
	\item A ladder can't be associated with a sport. To resolve this the sport name can be entered as the ladder name

	\item Artefacts are left behind when a user leaves a ladder, resulting in empty positions on the ladder
\end{itemize}
