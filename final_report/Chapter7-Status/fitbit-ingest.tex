Of the two defined acceptance tests for this microservice, all tests pass. Outside of the acceptance tests, there are two known issues:

\begin{itemize}
    \item A synchronization happens once per day, after this first request is completed no additional data is gathered for the day.
    \item If Fitbit revokes the user's access token the Aber Fitness system does not inform the user.
\end{itemize}
