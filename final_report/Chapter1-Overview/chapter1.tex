\chapter{Overview}

\textit{Aber Fitness} is a web application developed using Microsoft's \textit{.NET Core} and Oracle's \textit{Java Enterprise Edition} (henceforth referred to as Java EE). The project aims to provide a service to encourage fitness and promote engagement with sporting activities amongst the users of the application, offering functionality such as graphing fitness data gathered by owners of \textit{Fitbit} devices, the ability to challenge other users to competitions and a sport ladder system with tight integration into a bespoke facility booking system. \textit{Aber Fitness} aims to offer everything that would be needed by a sporty and active person in order to bring their sporting activities into a digital platform and also to enhance their use of devices they already own, such as \textit{Fitbit} devices or smart watches such as the \textit{Apple Watch}.

At launch the system will ingest activity data automatically from \textit{Fitbit}, with the capability of easily implementing other health data provider services at a later date due to the modular nature of the data ingest system. Once normalised this activity data will be used throughout the various subsystems of \textit{Aber Fitness}, providing users with functionality such as a dashboard overview of their activity over the last hour, day, week, etc. as well as integrating tightly into the challenges system to add a competitive aspect to the system in to keep users engaged with both the platform itself and keeping fit in general.
