\textit{Aber Fitness} is a web application developed using Microsoft's \textit{.NET Core} and Oracle's \textit{Java Enterprise Edition} (henceforth referred to as Java EE). The project aims to provide a service which encourages fitness and promotes engagement with sporting activities amongst the users of the application, by offering functionality such as:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Graphing fitness data gathered by owners of \textit{Fitbit} devices, or through manual input.
	\item The ability to take part in challenges based on that fitness data.
	\item Providing a Sport ladder system, which has tight integration with a bespoke facility booking system.
\end{itemize}

\textit{Aber Fitness} aims to offer everything required by a sporty and active person in order to bring their sporting activities onto a digital platform and also to enhance their use of devices they already own, such as fitness tracking devices or smart watches such as the \textit{Fitbit Charge}.

\par
At launch, the system will automatically ingest activity data from \textit{Fitbit}, and be open to the addition of other health data provider services, such as Apple Watch, at a later date due to the modular nature of the data ingest system. Once normalised, this activity data will be used throughout the various microservices within \textit{Aber Fitness}, providing users with functionality such as a dashboard overview of their activity over the past month, as well as integrating tightly with the challenges microservice to add a competitive aspect to the system, with the aim of keeping users engaged with both the platform itself and keeping fit in general.

\par
\textit{Aber Fitness} will also feature a number of supporting tools, such as:

\begin{itemize}
	\item A user management system with two-factor authentication.
	\item A comprehensive audit trail of when and how their data was used and accessed, which is filterable by date.
	\item A global layout template with a dynamic sidebar, which can be adjusted by administrators. Those changes will be instantly propagated to the other microservices.
\end{itemize}

\par
\textit{Aber Fitness} is also designed to be scalable and easily deployed through the use of \textit{Docker}, by segregating related functionality into individual microservices.
